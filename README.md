# COCC-HollyTravel

This is my first C++ assignment programme in my college

## ❤ Programme brief

Travel company books long distance flights for customer. A long-distance journey, from source to
destination, requires two flights. A single flight consists of:

1. A departure airport
2. A departure date
3. A departure time (hours and minutes)
4. An arrival airport
5. An arrival date
6. An arrival time (hours and minutes)
7. A journey length (hours and minutes)
8. A cost
9. A class (economy, premium economy, business or first class)

The boarding passes and summary letter are then printed to the customer.

A report is generated and lists the number of flights sold that day, the total cost
of the flights, and the commission earned by the travel agent (10% of the cost of the flights).

## ❤ Score and Some part of Feedback

Total: 28.48/30 = 94/94%

> Your coding is great and you use Object Oriented constructs e.g. getters, setters, operator overloading, classes and objects generally, very effectively.

## ❤ My opinon

There is some part I couldn't implement but it was a great exercise to learn C++ even thought It is a basic of C++ :)
